It requires C++17 (`std::variant`), you can build the executable by a simple `make`. Introduction to [Lox language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html#functions), similar syntax to C. Support for closue, class and inheritance is ongoing. Also you cannot define functions besides global scope, which is somehow related to closure that I am developing.
